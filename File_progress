Variables:

•	Meaning full name, starting with _ , letter(upper/lower case doesn’t matter)
•	Check for print (name + age) #where age is an int value
•	Cntrl +f1 for shortcut.
•	(name + age) java automatically converts in print case , from int age to string age, python doesn’t do that (in a way its good you wont have weird errors because of type conversion)
•	Data types are classified as numeric, sequences(basically strings), mappings, files, classes, instances and exceptions.
•	a/b gives answer as float number, a//b gives has a whole number.
•	Try that for loop at 12.16 #it causes problem in loop if you give a/b which a float but not an integer
•	Parrot = Norway, print(Parrot[3]) gives w , it returns a specific character at that line.
•	Print(Parrot[-1]) gives y , that’s because it starts from right side then in the reverse order, try Parrot[0:6] it will be Norway , try Parrot[:6], lecture 26. 6:30 onwards

String Formatting
•	27th video in reference
•	Str(age) – converts whats in bracket to string
•	String formatting operator is now being deprecated (is no longer recommended)in python 3, it was introduced in python2 and then used heavily so you still need to understand onld code
•	Check python pi values 22/7
