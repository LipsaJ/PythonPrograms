--chapter 30 code it, two programs one uses elif as well and one uses only(if else)
guess the number program(programs wants yu to guess five and gives you two chances)

-make ifProgramFlow project, check the bool values
go through all of the projects and made them

Augmented assignments is using teh short form
ex: cleaned_number = cleaned_number + i
instead you could do cleaned number += i

in the first case python evaluated two variables and then destroys one but in case of second one, python just modifies
thats going to be more efficient, so use this its more efficient
two binary operators could be applied on strings as well.
 those are +, *

example:
greetings = "Good "
greetings += "Morning "

print(greetings)

greetings *= 5
print(greetings)

----
if you use len you lose he build in function so dont do that

Variables:

•	Meaning full name, starting with _ , letter(upper/lower case doesn’t matter)
•	Check for print (name + age) #where age is an int value
•	Cntrl +f1 for shortcut.
•	(name + age) java automatically converts in print case , from int age to string age, python doesn’t do that (in a way its good you wont have weird errors because of type conversion)
•	Data types are classified as numeric, sequences(basically strings), mappings, files, classes, instances and exceptions.
•	a/b gives answer as float number, a//b gives has a whole number.
•	Try that for loop at 12.16 #it causes problem in loop if you give a/b which a float but not an integer
•	Parrot = Norway, print(Parrot[3]) gives w , it returns a specific character at that line.
•	Print(Parrot[-1]) gives y , that’s because it starts from right side then in the reverse order, try Parrot[0:6] it will be Norway , try Parrot[:6], lecture 26. 6:30 onwards

String Formatting
•	27th video in reference
•	Str(age) – converts whats in bracket to string
•	String formatting operator is now being deprecated (is no longer recommended)in python 3, it was introduced in python2 and then used heavily so you still need to understand onld code
•	Check python pi values 22/7
