print(name + ' : ' + str(age))
#(name + age) java automatically converts in print case , from int age to string age, python doesnâ€™t do that (in a way its good you wont have weird errors because of type conversion)

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b) #this is float
print(a//b) #this is whole number
